Thus far, these are the ones tripping up CI and some customers.  To cater to customers who might hit this, and to resolve issues in CI, we add this script as the default for the LeappInitCommand which runs immediately before leapp.  This ensures that it is there to cover the majority of customers, but it is also easily overridden with changes if further changes are required for the customer environment or for the future. It is also perfectly suitable to use the existing parameter instead of adding a new one.

https://review.opendev.org/795854,Avoid SRIOV misconfiguration at FEC device,"Avoid SRIOV misconfiguration at FEC device  When performing a batch SRIOV configuration (e.g. from shell script), it may be possible that commands consecutively issued - either related to interface(s) or a second FEC device settings - make the FEC device configuration to be not fully applied, and then unlock fails by semantic check.  The reason for that is hieradata might get updated by intermediate inventory reports that could overwrite the values to be set with the current ones, since it hasn't separate fields for both values. This change makes 'num_vfs' to be used as the ""configured"" value (like it is actually used in puppet manifest) and creates another 'sriov_vfs' that will contain the current value for number of VFs.  Another change is not calling platform::devices::fpga::fec::vf when applying runtime manifest, which could also fail in case PCI addresses are changing from what is in hieradata.

Currently, the validation time for a fernet token is 5x the time for a UUID token - so we're missing something,  One of the things we do differently for ferent tokens is check the group roles for federation tokens - and this wasn't cached, so this patch adds this.  It currently fails unit tests since some tests flips the inheritance flag mid-test (which effectively invalidates the cache). Also we don't yet invalidate the cache if group membership is changed, hence this patch is currently experimental so we can at least confirm that this has positive effect on performance.

This is known to trigger an outage that affects the network traffic for VMs running in your cloud (i.e. the worst kind of outage).  There are more clever and more scalable approaches, but it seems safer to always restart docker serially to avoid this kind of impact, until we have a better solution. This should be easily backportable, with any luck.  Problems: It is possible there are similar issues with accidential docker upgrades, but this isn't considered here. I am yet to test this on a live running system, this might not be slow enough to avoid a galera cluster loosing quorum, etc.  Change-Id: If5945ef3391d7e28e37f6f4c940919cd0dd938a2",782,John Garbutt,[22348],['Zuul'],Configuration Changes

https://review.opendev.org/794280,Check local pods only to prevent B&R timeout,"Check local pods only to prevent B&R timeout  This fix reworks a kubectl wait command to only wait for ready pods on the local controller. This fixes an issue where restoring a cluster with many nodes can timeout during ""Start wait for armada, calico-kube-controllers & coredns deployments to reach Available state"". This timeout was happening because the kubectl command was waiting for pods on downed nodes to become ready for 30 seconds per pod. In cases where there were 5 or more unreachable pods, the async timeout value of 120 seconds would be reached and the kubectl wait commands would be terminated before completion. This prevented subsequent Ansible tasks from completing and resulted in a parsing error during ""Fail if any of the Kubernetes component, Networking or Armada pods are not ready by this time""  The fix here adds --field-selector spec.nodeName=$(hostname) to the kubectl wait command and causes only pods on the running controller to be checked. This also ensures that the asyncronous tasks will always only take 30 seconds, regardless of the number of nodes in the cluser.  Removed the behaviour where the wait time would scale up based on the number of nodes, as the return time of the async tasks is now always a fixed 30 seconds.

https://review.opendev.org/794304,Fix bootstrap playbook when initializing kubernetes,"Fix bootstrap playbook when initializing kubernetes  The etcd endpoint in the kubedeadm file is different than the endpoint defined in the etcd config file. This is because in the kubeadm file, the etcd endpoint is equal to the 'cluster_floating_address' variable. And in the etcd config file the 'default_cluster_host_start_address' variable is used. These 2 variables can be different when the 'cluster_host_start_address' variable defined in the localhost.yml differs from the first address of the 'cluster_host_subnet'.  The solution is to use 'cluster_floating_address' in both cases because this variable is defined in the following way:  cluster_floating_address: ""{{ address_pairs['cluster_host']['start'] }}"" will be different than the 'default_cluster_host_start_address': ""{{ (cluster_host_subnet | ipaddr(1)).split('/')[0] }  So it will use 'default_cluster_host_start_address' when the 'cluster_host_start_address' is not defined.
